## 📚 Study Topics

### General Systems Theory

Collection of documents exploring systems theory, complexity, and emergent phenomena.

#### Foundations of General Systems Theory: A Survey of Formal Definitions
[![PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Download-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader)](https://github.com/izzortsi/weird-science/releases/download/latest/gst-overview.pdf)

A systematic compilation of foundational definitions of systems and major theoretical insights drawn from the mathematical literature on General Systems Theory.

#### Non-well-founded Hierarchies of Nested Systems
[![PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Download-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader)](https://github.com/izzortsi/weird-science/releases/download/latest/nested-systems.pdf)

A systematic investigation of the definitional foundations of complex systems, articulating a formalism grounded in the recursive nesting of subsystems and examining emergence as a structural phenomenon arising from inter-level functional dependencies.

### Formal Ontologies

Collection of documents on formal ontologies and knowledge representation.

#### Definitional Architectures: From Conceptualization to Ontology
[![PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Download-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader)](https://github.com/izzortsi/weird-science/releases/download/latest/formal-ontologies.pdf)

A philosophical excavation of formal system concepts, tracing the conceptual trajectory from extensional mathematical structures through intensional conceptualizations to formal ontologies, situated within the broader discourse of General Systems Theory.

Each document folder contains:
- `main.tex` - Main LaTeX document
- `sections/` - LaTeX source files organized by section
- `references/` - Bibliography files and reference materials
- `README.md` - Document-specific information

## 🔨 Building PDFs

PDFs are automatically built via GitHub Actions on every push to `dev` and for pull requests. You can:

- **Download the latest PDFs** from the [Releases](../../releases/latest) page
- **Build locally** by running `pdflatex` in each document directory
- **View PR-specific builds** as artifacts on pull request pages

## 📚 Zotero Integration

This repository is integrated with a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6182921/) to maintain literature references and generate knowledge artifacts:

- **Project Summaries** - Each project folder contains a `project-summary.md` with references matched to the Zotero library
- **Knowledge Database** - The `knowledge-database/` directory contains atomic concept articles organized hierarchically
- **Automated Generation** - GitHub Actions workflow generates knowledge base from LaTeX sources and Zotero data
- **Semantic Analysis** - Extracts concepts (Γ) from LaTeX and expands to related Zotero items (Γ⁺)
- **Interactive Exploration** - Local Docker setup provides a web UI for querying the Zotero library

For details, see:
- [Knowledge Base Workflow](docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE_WORKFLOW.md) - Automated generation process
- [Zotero Integration](docs/ZOTERO_INTEGRATION.md) - Complete integration guide

### Quick Start

```bash
# Generate knowledge base from LaTeX and Zotero
python scripts/zotero-integration/zotero_sync.py
python scripts/zotero-integration/knowledge_base_generator.py

# Or use the automated workflow (in GitHub Actions)
# Triggers on: manual dispatch or merges to dev with .tex changes

# Run local exploration UI
cd tools/zotero-mcp
docker-compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:5000
```
